# Inspector Pong
Ever wanted a one-player, and ultra slow version of pong? No? Well, here you have it anyway. Go nuts.

#### End Result:

If you have any doubt in how to use this *incredibly useful (?)* addition to your Unity project, it is a component. This means you can add it directly to any GameObject you want.

## General Notes
* There is really no point in having this on your project, just to have fun.
* This "tool", doesn't clean itself on builds, so it can go up to production if you are not careful (although it shouldn't impact your game at all).
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Pointless%20But%20Amusing/Pong) instead of the whole project if you want to.

## As A Reminder 
* If you make any changes/improvements to this tool, please do consider sharing them to update the repository. The easiest way to do so is via an e-mail to: contact@heisarzola.com
* This project's license is located in the repository root under the name "LICENSE.md".

## Bar Acknowledgments

* [abagames](https://github.com/abagames/pongpector) - For making pong available in the inspector.
* [Proto Turtle](https://github.com/ProtoTurtle/UnityBitmapDrawing) - For providing a way to draw bitmaps (including within the Unity Inpector).
