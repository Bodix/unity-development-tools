# Pointless But Amusing
Just as the title implies, there is really no specific reason or practical use at all to have these tools hanging out in your Unity project, but they are amusing anyway.

You can think about these as those little water drinking toy birds that sit around in your desk, just a minor happy distraction.

## General Notes

* The README within each tool folder contains relevant information to take into consideration when using a particular tool, so make sure to read them.
* Take into consideration that the tools located under the "Editor" will ***REQUIRE*** to be within an "Editor" named folder to work, regardless of where said folder is located. (For more information about the reason, look at [Unity's official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/SpecialFolders.html).)
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Pointless%20But%20Amusing) instead of the whole project if you want to.

## As A Reminder 
* If you make any changes/improvements to this tool, please do consider sharing them to update the repository. The easiest way to do so is via an e-mail to: contact@heisarzola.com
* This project's license is located in the repository root under the name "LICENSE.md".
