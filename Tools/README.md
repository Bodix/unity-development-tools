# Tools
These are a collection of several tools, shortcuts and editors, intended to make your life easier by enchancing Unity's default capabilities.

## General Notes

* The README within each tool folder contains relevant information to take into consideration when using a particular tool, so make sure to read them.
* Take into consideration that the tools located under the "Editor" will ***REQUIRE*** to be within an "Editor" named folder to work, regardless of where said folder is located. (For more information about the reason, look at [Unity's official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/SpecialFolders.html).)
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Tools) instead of the whole project if you want to.

## As A Reminder 
* If you make any changes/improvements to this tool, please do consider sharing them to update the repository via a pull request.
* This project's license is located in the repository root under the name "LICENSE.md".
