# Read Only Attribute
The ***Read Only*** attribute allows to disable an exposed field in the inspector to remain locked and un-editable there. Useful when something is desired to be seen in the inspector, but want that code makes the changes.

If any doubt on how to use the attribute arises, please see the provided examples for reference.

## General Notes
* If you switch the inspector to ***Debug Mode***, the fields will become editable. (In case you want to tweak something and never allow changes again).
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Attributes/Read%20Only) instead of the whole project if you want to.
